                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Hi there everybody. I'm Wyatt Miller, a programmer, a gamer, and a college student.</p>
                <p>I think I'll post my resume up here so I don't have to explain what I'm like. lol.</p>
                <p>I've worked in places where there's flashing lights and fans blowing hot air and you are really chilled to the bone. That's right, I've worked in IT. Let me tell you, IT is not a walk in the park compared to other jobs out there. Sure, you are around like-minded people that enjoy your company and you get to mess with the latest and greatest of technologies, but when you get down to it, it is hard. Griping with angry or upset customers and clients while trying to help politely and effectively is very difficult. When I get home after a work day, I just wanna take a nap or binge watch anime till I fall asleep. For me, though, IT is really fun.</p>
                <p>As a programmer, I always think of the big picture, cross platform. That's why my language of choice is either Python or Ruby. I would say Java too but Java is garbage, I'll talk about that later blog post. Yeah, I do program in C#, C and C++ before that, but that is more of futuristic approach to programming language as a whole with .NET Core. .NET Core is gift sent down from the gods, bringing with it cross platform-ability, ASP .NET Core, Visual Basic Core, and others. People should get on that shit ASAP. I know I am. Yeah, compiled languages are cool too but you have set up cross compiling and you have to grab a separate machine for testing (or a VM if your computer is beefy enough lol) and yeah, that's a mess, I don't toy with that. When I have an actual job, maybe I'll get a build server, I don't know. In college, I'm studying C#/.NET, HTML/CSS/JS, and MSSQL, in part of getting my CIT degree, which has been a bumpy ride, let me tell you.</p>
                <p>Anime binge watching is past time of mine as I find the animation very different from, let's say Pixar and Sony, do their animation. Plus, story telling in anime is really thought out and blows my mind most times. The exceptions I can give is No Game No Life and One Punch Man because I predict what is going to happen at the end of each episode. But, criticisms aside, I like watching Japanese animation whenever get the chance.</p>
                <p>Gaming is what I'm doing if I'm not programming. Those part of the whole PCMasterRace, I don't take part in it. I believe you make people fell bad for having a console when they prefer console. Yeah, I do game on a PC but I like console games as well. Anywhere from retro games made in the 80's/90's to AAA games, both PC and console, are fantastic. My favorite games are: FEZ, Doom, Undertale, Final Fantasy VI, and Super Mario World. Okay so you're probably disappointed that Final Fantasy VII and Super Mario 64 aren't on my best games list. If Final Fantasy VII had a better villain, it would beat VI. Super Mario World is a nostalgia trip for me every time I play since I started playing it when I was one. Sorry, my opinion would've been different if it wasn't for my uncle who had an SNES at the time of my infancy. Some people are complaining that Undertale is on my best games list as well. To sum it up, I had the most thrilling time with Undertale and I wasn't bombarded by spoilers like the people complaining. Suck it up. If you have a game you think I should try out, leave a comment and I'll try it out (except CoD, do NOT suggest CoD to me).</p>
                <p>I'll be adding more to this page so more is going to fill your eyeholes! I'm the eyehole man, nobody takes my eyeholes (anyone that guess that reference is going to be my best friend lol). </p>
                <p>Later.</p>
                <p>If you want my resume, I'll be posting that soon along with my cover letter.</p>
